# The Drake Equation #

**The Drake equation is designed to predict the likelihood of life elsewhere in the universe.**
**The following parameters are required to produce accurate results.**

--- 

**ARGUMENTS:**
   - -h : Help
   - -v : Version
   - -i : Command Line Input. ex: -i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - Must contain the seven values in correct order.
   - -s : Sample Data. This will display a best and worst case scenario based on the current scientific understanding and when the formula was surmised.
   - -a : Assisted Mode. This will give the user hints as they progress through the variables.
        

**USAGE:**
    This program will allow you to input various values to see what the Drake equation will result in.

**The Drake equation is:**

    N = R∗ ⋅ fp ⋅ ne ⋅ fl ⋅ fi ⋅ fc ⋅ L 

**where:**

    N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone)

**and:**

    R∗ = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy(years)
    fp = the fraction of those stars that have planets
    ne = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets
    fl = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point
    fi = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)
    fc = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
    L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space
