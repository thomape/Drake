    The Drake equation is designed to predict the liklihood of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
    The following parameters are required to produce accurate results.

        N= The number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable.

        R*= The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life (number per year).

        fp= The fraction of those stars with planetary systems.

        ne= The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life.

        fl= The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears.

        fi= The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges.

        fc= The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that produces detectable signs of their existence.

        L= The average length of time such civilizations produce such signs (years).
